[ids]
*

[main]
# Primary remappings
capslock = control
meta = control
leftmeta = control
rightmeta = control

# Optional: Uncomment to keep right meta as meta key
# rightmeta = meta

# Optional: Swap Alt and Control (uncomment if desired)
# leftalt = control
# leftcontrol = leftalt
# rightalt = control
# rightcontrol = rightalt

# Optional: Function key behavior
# fn = fn

# Optional: Additional Mac-like mappings
# Insert key to forward delete (if you have an insert key)
# insert = delete

[control]
# When holding control, these combinations work like Mac
# These are already handled by the meta->control mapping above
# but you can add custom combinations here if needed

[alt]
# Alt layer customizations (if needed)
# Example: Alt+Tab for window switching
# tab = A-tab

[shift]
# Shift layer customizations (if needed)

```

Then download RustDesk on your Mac/Windows/phone and connect using the displayed ID!

## üåê File Sync & Secure Networking

Omarchy includes modern networking tools for seamless connectivity:

### **Syncthing - Decentralized File Sync**
```bash
# Access web interface (auto-starts after installation)
http://localhost:8384

# Add devices and sync folders across all your machines
# No cloud required - direct peer-to-peer synchronization
```

### **Tailscale - Zero-Config VPN**
```bash
# Connect your device to your Tailscale network
sudo tailscale up

# Access all your devices securely from anywhere
# Works behind NAT/firewalls without port forwarding
```

Both services start automatically and provide secure, private alternatives to cloud services.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Key Remapping

Omarchy includes keyd configuration for Mac-like key behavior (installed by default):

```bash
# Manage keyd configuration
omarchy-keyd status    # Show current status
omarchy-keyd reload    # Reload configuration
omarchy-keyd edit      # Edit configuration
omarchy-keyd test      # Test key mappings
```

**Default mappings (automatically configured):**
- **Caps Lock ‚Üí Control**
- **Meta/Super/Cmd ‚Üí Control**
- This makes Cmd+C, Cmd+V, etc. work like on Mac

## üìù Neovim Configuration

Omarchy respects your existing Neovim configuration and provides tools to manage it:

```bash
# Install Neovim (preserves existing config)
source ~/.local/share/omarchy/install/nvim.sh

# Manage your nvim configuration
omarchy-nvim status           # Show current config status
omarchy-nvim backup           # Backup current config
omarchy-nvim link ~/my-config # Symlink to your config
omarchy-nvim reset            # Remove config for fresh start
```

**Features:**
- **Preserves existing configs** - Never overwrites your setup
